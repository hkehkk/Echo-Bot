# EchoBot

#This project was my first time attempting to work with Microsoft SDK Bot Framework. I created a bot that stores the information from the user about setting up a cleaning service. The bot can have a conversation with the client. The bot framework is quite amazing, it is quite complex. I had fun being able to be creative with this project. 
#Since I have done quite a bit of work in Microsoft Visual Studio, I am quite familiar with how the program works and the C# language. The bot was created entirely in C#. When I became stuck in my code, I looked for resources that helped me through. This chatbot project required a great amount of patience and focus. There was trial and error, but the chatbot came together in the end. 
#The bot required a great amount of time to configure all the pieces that run the bot. I had to do that before I was able to program code that would customize the bot. Configuring the bot is more of a task as there were concepts that I have not learned in classes. Because of this I was able to challenge myself as a programmer and really see what I was capable of. 
#With this project I gained more information in the C# language as well as the entire bot framework. I learned that it was best to for entire segments of code and run it to learn from  my mistakes, if any in that code. With every error I expanded my knowledge of coding. This project was challenging yet very informative.
